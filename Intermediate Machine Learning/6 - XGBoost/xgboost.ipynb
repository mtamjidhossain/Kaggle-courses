This method dominates many Kaggle competitions and achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of datasets. \n\n# Introduction\n\nFor much of this course, you have made predictions with the random forest method, which achieves better performance than a single decision tree simply by averaging the predictions of many decision trees.\n\nWe refer to the random forest method as an \"ensemble method\".  By definition, **ensemble methods** combine the predictions of several models (e.g., several trees, in the case of random forests).  \n\nNext, we'll learn about another ensemble method called gradient boosting.  \n\n# Gradient Boosting\n\n**Gradient boosting** is a method that goes through cycles to iteratively add models into an ensemble.  \n\nIt begins by initializing the ensemble with a single model, whose predictions can be pretty naive.  (Even if its predictions are wildly inaccurate, subsequent additions to the ensemble will address those errors.)\n\nThen, we start the cycle:\n- First, we use the current ensemble to generate predictions for each observation in the dataset.  To make a prediction, we add the predictions from all models in the ensemble.  \n- These predictions are used to calculate a loss function (like [mean squared error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error), for instance).\n- Then, we use the loss function to fit a new model that will be added to the ensemble.  Specifically, we determine model parameters so that adding this new model to the ensemble will reduce the loss.  (*Side note: The \"gradient\" in \"gradient boosting\" refers to the fact that we'll use [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) on the loss function to determine the parameters in this new model.*)\n- Finally, we add the new model to ensemble, and ...\n- ... repeat!\n\n![tut6_boosting](https://i.imgur.com/MvCGENh.png)\n\n\n# Example\n\nWe begin by loading the training and validation data in `X_train`, `X_valid`, `y_train`, and `y_valid`.

Early stopping causes the model to stop iterating when the validation score stops improving, even if we aren't at the hard stop for `n_estimators`.  It's smart to set a high value for `n_estimators` and then use `early_stopping_rounds` to find the optimal time to stop iterating.\n\nSince random chance sometimes causes a single round where validation scores don't improve, you need to specify a number for how many rounds of straight deterioration to allow before stopping.  Setting `early_stopping_rounds=5` is a reasonable choice.  In this case, we stop after 5 straight rounds of deteriorating validation scores.\n\nWhen using `early_stopping_rounds`, you also need to set aside some data for calculating the validation scores - this is done by setting the `eval_set` parameter.  \n\nWe can modify the example above to include early stopping:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"my_model = XGBRegressor(n_estimators=500)\nmy_model.fit(X_train, y_train, \n             early_stopping_rounds=5,             # Verbose: with False (e.g. 0) it does not print anything.
